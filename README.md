# DotGraphics
A terminal graphics program with sub-character precision using unicode braille characters.

This has only been tested on OSX. I'm using special characters to clear the screen (instead of system("cls") on Windows), and I'm not sure how well Windows handles unicode characters in a console window. 

## Example

I made a quick example of DotGraphics drawing using a [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics). Sorry for the terrible gif quality!
